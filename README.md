Market segmentation using clustering methods
Carried out exploratory data analysis on a marketing dataset about customer behavior(Pandas, NumPy).
• Clustered data using Ward's method, complete linkage method, and k-means method; applied PCA for dimensionality reduction(Scikit-learn).
• Visualized the formed clusters using the appropriate Python libraries for visualization(Seaborn and Matplotlib); analyzed the obtained results using the resulting visualization of cluster distributions by individual characteristics of objects.
• Divided customers into segments to optimize the significance of each customer to the business for modifying products according to the distinct needs and behaviors of the customers.
